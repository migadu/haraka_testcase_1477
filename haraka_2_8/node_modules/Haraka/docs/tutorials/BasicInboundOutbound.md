A Basic Inbound and Outbound Haraka
===================================

This tutorial will teach you how to setup Haraka for both inbound and outbound mail.

What we will have at the end of this is:

* An inbound Haraka server that stops spam and delivers onwards to Postfix for user delivery
* An outbound Haraka server that provides user authentication for delivery to the internet

First some explanations.

Why do we need two servers? The answer is we do not **need** two servers, it is
just cleaner that way. It's nice to segregate our functionality in two. Inbound
and outbound have very different needs, especially in terms of filtering, so
it is the author's personal preference to have different systems.

Why do we still need Postfix if we have Haraka? Haraka does not implement user
delivery - delivering to a user's mbox file, Maildir, or IMAP folder. This is
the most security critical part of mail infrastructure and
historically one with the most holes. As such we leave this to software which
has had significant review, such as Postfix or Qmail. In the future it may
be possible to deliver directly to those systems, at which time we will update
this tutoral.
