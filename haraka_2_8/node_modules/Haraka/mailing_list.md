A Haraka Mailing List Manager
=============================

What we need
------------

* Emails to the list get sent out to all members (duh!)

* Bounces result in users getting removed, if they bounce enough? Depends if
  the first email bounces or subsequent ones? Need hooks in outbound layer.
  NB: For outbound layer hooks, need to change things to happen inside the
  hmail object, and run hooks from there. Otherwise we have no way to
  wrap plugin responders.

* Support list-sub@domain list-unsub@domain, etc

* List archives - web based

* Modify body of email to put unsub instructions in?

* Add appropriate headers, List-Unsubscribe etc

* VERP the emails (means we need to queue 1 email per recipient)

* Deal with VERP bounces same way we deal with 5xx rejections at send time.

* Subscriber moderation

* List moderation - this will require storing the mail and having a way
  of delivering the original when it has been approved.

* What if user@the_local_domain is signed up - needs delivered locally via
  the regular queue mechanism.

* Web interface for managing your subscription - signup, change email address,
  unsubscribe, change delivery options.

What can come later
-------------------

* First-post moderation - new subscribers' first post is moderated to prevent
  signup abusers who sign up, spam, and don't care about the consequences.
  This feature could come later as most lists won't have such spam problems
  in the beginning.

* Posting from the web interface?

* Digest mode? I hate these personally - just use the web UI, but some people
  seem to like them.

Backend
-------

I'd love to try with couchdb but I don't know much about it. Advantage: theres
already a haraka-couchdb project.

Alternatively SQLite? One db per mailing list. Scalability issues maybe, but
cross that bridge after we hit 20m emails per day :)

Commercials
-----------

* Free?

  * Perhaps github model? Free for public groups. Pay for private.

* Ad supported like google groups?

* Ads in the emails?

* Suggest at least free to get initial signups - need to work out kinks
  first. Especially outbound.js has not had much of a workout.
