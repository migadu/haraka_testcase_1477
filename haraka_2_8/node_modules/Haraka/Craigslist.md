Craigslist Chooses Haraka for Next Generation SMTP Server
=========================================================

Craigslist, the local classifieds and forums site, has chosen the open
source Haraka SMTP Server to help them improve their email service,
and provide them with a platform for building the next iteration of
their email service.

Craigslist is used by over 50 million users in the US alone. Their
previous email architecture
was holding them back on providing more features via email, and their
spam load was crushing their servers on a daily basis.

By choosing Haraka, a flexible mail server written using the modern
Node.js framework, craigslist's mail servers are now able to receive
twice as much traffic, with a simultaneous massive 4x reduction in
computing resources used, compared with their previous Postfix
based installation. [*]

Haraka is an SMTP server designed for scalability and configurability
in mind. It takes plugins written in Javascript to hook into any
part of the SMTP conversation, providing a ideal means with which to
perform email filtering, sender and recipient filtering and
modification, authentication, content modification, and custom
delivery.

Craigslist has contributed significantly to the development of Haraka,
and hopes to continue to provide new plugins and features to the open
source project.
